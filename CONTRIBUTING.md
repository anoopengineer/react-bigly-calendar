## Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people
like you that make our world a better place.

### Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make a new issue report][new issue]! It's
generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature
request before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork this repo] and create
a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #325 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### Get the test suite running

### Implement your fix or feature

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜¸

Remember, your commit messages should follow [Conventional Commit Format](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

Types of commit:

feat: Add a new feature (equivalent to a MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
fix: Fix a bug (equivalent to a PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
docs: Documentation changes.
style: Code style change (semicolon, indentation...).
refactor: Refactor code without changing public API.
perf: Update code performances.
test: Add test to an existing feature.
chore: Update something without impacting the user (ex: bump a dependency in package.json).

### Get the style right

### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your master branch and make sure it's
up to date with Active Admin's master branch:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:activeadmin/activeadmin.git
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of master, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git rebase master
git push --set-upstream origin 325-add-japanese-translations
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request][] :D

CircleCI will run our test suite against all supported Rails versions. We care
about quality, so your PR won't be merged until all tests pass. It's unlikely,
but it's possible that your changes pass tests in one Rails version but fail in
another. In that case, you'll have to setup your development environment (as
explained in step 3) to use the problematic Rails version, and investigate
what's going on!

### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code
has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

To learn more about rebasing in Git, there are a lot of [good][git rebasing]
[resources][interactive rebase] but here's the suggested workflow:

```sh
git checkout 325-add-japanese-translations
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease 325-add-japanese-translations
```

### Merging a PR (maintainers only)

A PR can only be merged into master by a maintainer if:

- It is passing CI.
- It has been approved by at least two maintainers. If it was a maintainer who
  opened the PR, only one extra approval is needed.
- It has no requested changes.
- It is up to date with current master.

Any maintainer is allowed to merge a PR if all of these conditions are
met.

### Shipping a release (maintainers only)

Maintainers need to do the following to push out a release:
